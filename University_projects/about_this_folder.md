# University Projects in Data Structures

During the second semester of 2021, i was assigned 17 short coding projects which composed part of my grades in the Data Structures course (MC202) at UNICAMP. This folder contains all the code i wrote in that context. 

Please note that all the files are written in Portuguese, which is the language in which the course was lectured.
